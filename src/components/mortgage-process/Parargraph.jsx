              A mortgage is a type of loan used to purchase or maintain a home,
              plot of land, or other types of real estate. The borrower agrees
              to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular
              payments that are divided into principal and interest. The
              property then serves as collateral to secure the loan.

            Obtaining a mortgage can feel like a daunting and intricate process.
            With a multitude of mortgage options to consider and a substantial

            However, the mortgage journey can be compartmentalized into a series
            of clear-cut phases. Typically, individuals navigate through six
            distinct stages when seeking a new mortgage: pre-approval, house
            hunting, mortgage application, loan processing, underwriting, and
            closing.
